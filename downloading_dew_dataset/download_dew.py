"""
This script downloads the dew (Date Estimation in the Wild) dataset.

Images only until the year 1950 are downloaded.

The script checks which of the images are already downloaded,
collects bad response requests and timeouts when requesting.

In that regard the script can continue itÂ´s work when restarted
after any kind of exception or shut down.
